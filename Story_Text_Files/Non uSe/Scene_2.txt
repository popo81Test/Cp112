: Detective Toei arrived at the entrance of Sri Khoraphum Castle.
: The cold was coming through the door.
: There was a cold wind whispering like someone asking for help.
: Suddenly, a young woman came up to ask to join the journey.
Toei[Panic]: Who there!!?!
Chicha[Normal]: Hello, my name is Chicha. I am the descendant of the shaman who looks after this Srikhon Castle.
Chicha[Normal]: You must have come to find "Guy", right?
Toei[Normal]: Yes, we are.
Toei[Doubt]: But shaman???
Toei[Doubt]: Do these kinds of things still exist in this era? And how do you know Guy.
Chicha[Normal]: I am a medium. Thatâ€™s all you need to know. But I will never hurt you.
Chicha[Normal]: Guy is also my friend.
Toei[Smile]: That great. I just need someone in the area to help me find a way.
Toei[Normal]: My name is Toei. This is my assistant Kitty.
Chicha[Normal]: (Chicha looking at the entrance, hesitating)
Chicha[Normal]: I am not sure... if today is a good day to go in.
Chicha[Normal]: Grandma used to say that if anyone enters Srikhon Castle during the full moon... the ghost will wake up.
